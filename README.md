## About The Project

This repository is related to the paper "Strawberry picking point localisation ripeness and weight estimation" accepted for ICRA 2022,PA. 
In particular it contains the 2 novel datasets presented in the paper.

## Usage

In the folder ```annotations/``` the annotations for the 2 datasets are present splitted into ```dyson_annotations/``` and ```SDI_annotations/```. In each json file the bounding box, the keypoints and the category (ripe/unripe) are annotated.

In the folder ```dataset/dyson_daatset/``` there are the images belonging to the dyson dataset (depth, RGB).
The SDI dataset of images can be instead downloaded from [this link](https://strawdi.github.io)
